      OkHttp is an HTTP client that’s efficient by default: HTTP/2 support allows all requests to the same host to share a socket. Connection pooling reduces request latency (if HTTP/2 isn’t available). Transparent GZIP shrinks download sizes. Response caching avoids the network completely for repeat requests.
